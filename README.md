#How to Play the Game
The game is a simple memory testing game, using cards. The game consists of a 4 x 4 grid of cards which default to the face-down positon.
The opposite of each card features a fantasy based creature from the popular role-playing game "Dungeons & Dragons".

The game officially begins when the first match attempt of two cards occurs; this starts the countdown timer. 
On each turn, the player flips over one card to reveal the monster hiding underneath. 
The player then turns over a second card, hoping it's revealed monster matches the first flipped card's monster.
If the monsters match, both cards will stay flipped right-side up, and are removed from play. 
If the two flipped cards are not a match, they will both turn back over and the sequence begins again.
The game is won when the player has successfully matched all 8 pairs of cards. 

#h1Cool Features
* There is a counter than increases by 1 for every 2 cards that are flipped over.
* The player's performance is rated using a "3 star" rating system, dependant on the amount of moves the player engages in.
* The timer only starts once 2 cards have been attempted to match.
* When the player has successfully defeated all the monsters, a pop-up will appear letting the player know they were succesful, and informing them they can play again, if they wish.
* The player can reset the cards, move counter, timer and star rating by clicking the reset button.
